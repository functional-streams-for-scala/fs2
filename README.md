scalaz-stream
=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scalaz/scalaz-stream.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/scalaz/scalaz-stream)

### Where to get it ###

To get the latest version of the library, add the following to your SBT build:

``` scala
resolvers += "Scalaz Bintray Repo" at "http://dl.bintray.com/scalaz/releases"

libraryDependencies += "org.scalaz.stream" %% "scalaz-stream" % "0.3.1"
```

The library only builds against Scala 2.10, not earlier versions.

### About the library ###

`scalaz-stream` is a streaming I/O library. The design goals are compositionality, expressiveness, resource safety, and speed. The design is meant to supercede or replace older iteratee or iteratee-style libraries. Here's a simple example of its use:

``` scala
import scalaz.stream._
import scalaz.concurrent.Task

val converter: Task[Unit] =
  io.linesR("testdata/fahrenheit.txt").
     filter(s => !s.trim.isEmpty && !s.startsWith("//")).
     map(line => fahrenheitToCelsius(line.toDouble).toString).
     intersperse("\n").
     pipe(text.utf8Encode).
     to(io.fileChunkW("testdata/celsius.txt")).
     run

// at the end of the universe...
val u: Unit = converter.run
```

This will construct a `Task`, `converter`, which reads lines incrementally from `testdata/fahrenheit.txt`, skipping blanklines and commented lines. It then parses temperatures in degrees fahrenheit, converts these to celsius, UTF8 encodes the output and writes incrementally to `testdata/celsius.txt`, using constant memory. The input and output files will be closed in the event of normal termination or exceptions.

The library supports a number of other interesting use cases:

* _Zipping and merging of streams:_ A streaming computations may read from multiple sources in a streaming fashion, zipping or merging their elements using a arbitrary `Tee`. In general, clients have a great deal of flexibility in what sort of topologies they can define--source, sinks, and effectful channels are all first-class concepts in the library.
* _Dynamic resource allocation:_ A streaming computation may allocate resources dynamically (for instance, reading a list of files to process from a stream built off a network socket), and the library will ensure these resources get released in the event of normal termination or when errors occur.
* _Nondeterministic and concurrent processing:_ A computation may read from multiple input streams simultaneously, using whichever result comes back first, and a pipeline of transformation can allow for nondeterminism and queueing at each stage.
* _Streaming parsing (UPCOMING):_ A separate layer handles constructing streaming parsers, for instance, for streaming JSON, XML, or binary parsing. See [the roadmap](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz-stream/wiki/Roadmap) for more information on this and other upcoming work.

### Related projects ###

[Machines](https://github.com/ekmett/machines/) is a Haskell library with the same basic design as `scalaz-stream`, though some of the particulars differ. There is also [`scala-machines`](https://github.com/runarorama/scala-machines), which is an older, deprecated version of the basic design of `scalaz-stream`.

There are various other iteratee-style libraries for doing compositional, streaming I/O in Scala, notably the [`scalaz/iteratee`](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/tree/scalaz-seven/iteratee) package and [iteratees in Play](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.0/Iteratees).
