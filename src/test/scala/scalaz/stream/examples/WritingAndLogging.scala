  A `Writer[F,W,O]` is a `Process[F, W \/ O]`. See
  `WriterSyntax` for convenience functions
  for working with either the written values (the `W`)
  or the output values (the `O`).

  This is useful for logging or other situations where we
  want to emit some values 'on the side' while doing something
  else with the main output of a `Process`.

  Let's look at an example:

  */

  property("writer") = secure {

    /* Give this a short name since we'll be using it a lot. */
    val P = Process

    /* For testing - we'll be accumulating into this buffer. */
    val buf = new collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[String]

    /*
    A full example, which we'll break down line by line
    in a minute. For each number in 0 to 10, this writes
    messages to the mutable `buf`:

      Got input: 1
      Got input: 2
      ...

    The integers are still available for further transforms.
    */

      Process.range(0,10)
             .flatMap(i => P.tell("Got input: " + i) ++ P.emitO(i))
             .toSource
             .observeW(io.fillBuffer(buf))
             .stripW

    /* This will have the side effect of filling `buf`. */
    ex.run.unsafePerformSync

    /* Let's break this down. */

    /* The original input. */
    val step0: Process[Task,Int] = P.range(0,10)

    /*
    Log some output using `W.tell`, and echo the original
    input with `W.emitO` (`O` for 'output').
    */
    val step1: Writer[Task,String,Int] =
      step0.flatMap { i => P.tell("Got input: " + i) ++ P.emitO(i) }

    /*
    A `Sink` which as a side effect writes to a mutable
    `Buffer`. This is more useful for testing.
    */
    val snk: Sink[Task,String] = io.fillBuffer(buf)

    /*
    Another `Sink` we could use for our `Writer`, if
    we want to log the writes to standard out, with
    a newline after each `String`.

    Of course, rather than picking `snk` or `snk2`,
    we could also take the `Sink` to use for logging
    as an argument, if we want our code to be agnostic
    to the logging strategy.
    */
    val snk2: Sink[Task,String] = io.stdOutLines

    /*
    The `observeW` function observes the write values of
    a `Writer` using some `Sink`, and then the `stripW`
    function discards the write side of the writer to get
    back an ordinary `Process`. Notice the `Int` output
    is still available for further transformation.
    */

    /* Make sure all values got written to the buffer. */
