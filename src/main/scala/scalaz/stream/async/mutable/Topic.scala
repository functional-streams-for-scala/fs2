 * Represents topic, that asynchronously exchanges messages between one or more publisher(s)

 * - Order of messages from publisher is guaranteed to be preserved to all subscribers
 * - Messages from publishers may interleave in non deterministic order before they are read by subscribers
 * - Once the `subscriber` is run it will receive all messages from all `publishers` starting with very first message
 *   arrived AFTER the subscriber was run
 *
 * Please not that topic is `active` even when there are no publishers or subscribers attached to it. However
 * once the `close` or `fail` is called all the publishers and subscribers will terminate or fail.
