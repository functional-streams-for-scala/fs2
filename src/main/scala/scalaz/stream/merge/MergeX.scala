/**
 * Low-level asynchronous primitive that allows asynchronously and
 * non-deterministically to merge multiple processes and external effects
 * together to create source in form of other processes.
 *
 * Please consider using its variants from [[scalaz.stream.async]] or [[scalaz.stream.merge]] package
 * before using this directly.
 *
 * Merging process is controlled by MergeXStrategy which takes form of
 * Process1, that on input side has [[scalaz.stream.merge.MergeX.MergeSignal]]
 * and on output side [[scalaz.stream.merge.MergeX.MergeAction]].
 * Please see [[scalaz.stream.merge.MergeXStrategies]] for more details.
 *
 * Processes that push to MergeX are called `upstream` processes and processes
 * that take from the the merge are called `downstream` processes.
 *
 * The mergeX starts once at least one `downstream` Process is run, and will
 * stop when `MergeXStrategy` stops.
 *
 * At any time user of MergeX can call `downstreamClose` method, that will cause
 * [[scalaz.stream.merge.MergeX.DoneDown]] to be dispatched to `MergeXStrategy`.
 *
 * Similarly, when Process providing `upstream` processes (the `source`) will terminate, this
 * MergeX will signal to MergeStrategy [[scalaz.stream.merge.MergeX.DoneUp]] message to indicate that
 * no more `Upstream` channels will provide values in the merge except those
 * providing already.
 *
 * Note there are two kind of `upstream` references :
 *
 * - `from source`, created by running processes provided by source and
 * - `volatile` that are provided by `receiveOne` and `upstreamSink` methods. These are not
 * consulted when [[scalaz.stream.merge.MergeX.DoneUp]] is dispatched to MergeX strategy.
