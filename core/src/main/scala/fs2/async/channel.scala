   * Pass elements of `s` through both `f` and `g`, then combine the two resulting streams.
   * Implemented by enqueueing elements as they are seen by `f` onto a `Queue` used by the `g` branch.
   * USE EXTREME CARE WHEN USING THIS FUNCTION. Deadlocks are possible if `combine` pulls from the `g`
   * branch synchronously before the queue has been populated by the `f` branch.
   *
   * The `combine` function receives an `F[Int]` effect which evaluates to the current size of the
   * `g`-branch's queue.
   *
   * When possible, use one of the safe combinators like `[[observe]]`, which are built using this function,
   * in preference to using this function directly.
