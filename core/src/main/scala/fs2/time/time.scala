  /**
   * Discrete stream that every `d` emits elapsed duration
   * since the start time of stream consumption.
   *
   * For example: `awakeEvery(5 seconds)` will
   * return (approximately) `5s, 10s, 20s`, and will lie dormant
   * between emitted values.
   *
   * This uses an implicit `Scheduler` for the timed events, and
   * runs the consumer using the `S` `Strategy`, to allow for the
   * stream to decide whether result shall be run on
   * different thread pool, or with `Strategy.sequential` on the
   * same thread pool as the scheduler.
   *
   * Note: for very small values of `d`, it is possible that multiple
   * periods elapse and only some of those periods are visible in the
   * stream. This occurs when the scheduler fires faster than
   * periods are able to be published internally, possibly due to
   * a `Strategy` that is slow to evaluate.
   *
   * @param d           FiniteDuration between emits of the resulting stream
   * @param S           Strategy to run the stream
   * @param scheduler   Scheduler used to schedule tasks
