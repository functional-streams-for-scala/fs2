/**
  * Scope represents a controlled block of execution of the stream to track resources acquired and released during
  * the interpretation of the Stream.
  *
  * Scope may have associated resources with it and cleanups, that are evaluated when the scope closes.
  *
  * Scope lifetime:
  *
  * When stream interpretation starts, one `root` scope is created. Then Scopes are created and closed based on the
  * stream structure, but as a rule of thumb every time when you convert Stream to `Pull` and back to Stream you are
  * creating one scope (opening and closing) the scope.
  *
  * So for example `s.chunks` is defined with `s.repeatPull` which in turn is defined with `Pull.loop(...).stream`. In this
  * case you always open and close single Scope.
  *
  * Scopes may be as well opened and closed manually with Stream#scope. Given `s.scope` that will open the scope before
  * the stream `s` to be evaluated and will close the scope once the stream finishes its evaluation.
  *
  * Scope organization
  *
  * Scopes are organized in tree structure, with each scope having at max one parent (root has no parent)
  * with Nil or more child scopes.
  *
  * Every time a new scope is created, it is inheriting parent from the current scope and it is adding itself to be
  * child scope of that parent.
  *
  * During the interpretation of nondeterministic stream (i.e. merge) there may be multiple scopes attached to single parent
  * and these scopes may be created and closed in nondeterministic order.
  *
  * Parent scope never outlives the child scopes. That means when parent scope is closed for whatever reason, the child
  * scopes are closed too.
  *
  * Resources
  *
  * Primary role of the scope is track resource allocation and release. The Stream interpreter guarantees, that
  * resources allocated in the scope are released always when the scope closes.
  *
  * Resource allocation
  *
  * Resource is allocated when interpreter interprets `Acquire` algebra. That is result of the Stream#bracket construct.
  * Please see `Resource` for details how this is done.
  *
  * @param id           Unique identification of the scope
  * @param parent       If empty indicates root scope. If nonemtpy, indicates parent of this scope
