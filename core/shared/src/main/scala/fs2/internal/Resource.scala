/**
  * Represent resource acquired during stream interpretation
  *
  * Resource is acquired by Algebra.Acquire and then released either by Algebra.Release or Algebra.CloseScope.
  *
  * The acquisition of the Resource has three steps:
  *
  * 1. Resource is created and registered with the scope (Algebra.Acquire)
  * 2. Resource is acquired
  * 3. Resource `acquired` is invoked to confirm acquisition of the resource.
  *
  * The reason for this is that during asynchronous stream evaluation, one scope may cause to close the other scope
  * (i.e merged stream fails while one of the other streams still acquiring asynchronous resources).
  * In that case, the resource may be `released` before `acquired` was evaluated, and as such
  * will make that resource to be released immediately when resource will be acquired..
  *
  * The resource may be released by any of the following methods:
  *
  * (1) The Algebra.Resource is interpreted. In this case resource finalization will be invoked if
  *     the resource was successfully acquired (the `acquired` was evaluated and resource was not leased other scope)
  * (2) The owning Scope was closed by `Algebra.CloseScope`. This essentially evaluates `release` of
  *     the Resource and acts like (1).
  * (3) The `acquired` was evaluated after scope was `released` by either (1) or (2). In this case
  *     resource will invoke the finalization immediately if the resource is not leased.
  * (4) The `cancelLease` is invoked for previously leased resource. This will invoke resource
  *     finalization if resource was already acquired and released and there are no more outstanding leases.
  *
  * Resources may be leased to other scopes. In that case, each scope must lease resource with `lease` and
  * when scope is closed (or when the resource lease is no longer required) release the lease with `cancelLease`.
  *
  * Note that every method which as part of its invocation may potentially call resource finalizer
  * is returning `F[Either[Throwable, Unit]]` instead just simple F[Unit] to make sure the errors when releasing resource
  * are properly handled.
