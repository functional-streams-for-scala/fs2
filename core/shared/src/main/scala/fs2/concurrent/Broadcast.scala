/** Provides mechanisms for broadcast distribution of elements to multiple streams. */
object Broadcast {

  /**
    * Allows elements of a stream to be broadcast to multiple workers.
    *
    * As the elements arrive, they are broadcast to all `workers` that have started evaluation before the
    * element was pulled.
    *
    * Elements are pulled as chunks from the source and the next chunk is pulled when all workers are done
    * with processing the current chunk. This behaviour may slow down processing of incoming chunks by
    * faster workers. If this is not desired, consider using the `prefetch` and `prefetchN` combinators on workers to compensate
    * for slower workers.
    *
    * Often this combinator is used together with parJoin, such as :
    *
    * {{{
    *   Stream(1,2,3,4).broadcast.map { worker =>
    *     worker.evalMap { o => IO.println("1:" + o.toString) }
    *   }.take(3).parJoinUnbounded.compile.drain.unsafeRunSync
    * }}}
    *
    * Note that in the example, above the workers are not guaranteed to see all elements emitted. This is
    * due to different subscription times of each worker and speed of emitting the elements by the source.
    * If this is not desired, consider using `broacastThrough` and `broadcastTo`, which are built on top of `Broadcast.through`, as an alternative.
    * They will hold on pulling from  source if there are no workers ready.
    *
    * When `source` terminates, then the inner streams (workers) are terminated once all elements pulled
    * from `source` are processed by all workers. However, note that when that `source` terminates,
    * resulting stream will not terminate until the inner streams terminate.
    *
    * @param minReady specifies that broadcasting will hold off until at least `minReady` subscribers will
    *                 be ready
